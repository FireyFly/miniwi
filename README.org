#+title: Miniwi font

[[./preview.png]]

This is a font in a 8x4 format (including spaces), made from scratch,
but with inspiration from the
[[http://robey.lag.net/2010/01/23/tiny-monospace-font.html][tom
thumb]] font (thank you, Robey!).

On a 320x240 raspberry screen, it can display 80x30 (2400) characters.

Then on my laptop screen...

It support ASCII, some accents, most box-drawing characters, and all
braille characters to make it suitable for
[[https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille][drawille]].

* More?

I have mosts of the glyph I need, and if you want some more, ask me
and I may add them!

Contributions are welcome as well.

* Build

The psf tty font is generated by a slightly modified version of
=bdf2psf= (to prevent a bug, I hardcoded the font width):

#+begin_src sh
  ./bdf2psf --fb\
            ../miniwi.bdf\
            ./standard.equivalents\
            ./useful.set+./ascii.set+./linux.set\
            256\
            ../miniwi.psfu
#+end_src

Otherwise, I build the font with fontforge.
