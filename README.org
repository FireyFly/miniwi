#+title: Miniwi font

This is a font in a 8x4 format (including spaces), made from scratch,
but with inspiration from the
[[http://robey.lag.net/2010/01/23/tiny-monospace-font.html][tom
thumb]] font (thank you, Robey!).

On a 320x240 raspberry screen, it can display 80x30 (2400) characters.

Then on my laptop screen...

[[./screenshot.png]]

It support the characters from these encodings:

- ASCII characters (easy!)
- ISO 8859-{1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14} (Latin 0 to 8)
- ISO 8859-5 and KOI8-R (Cyrilic) 
- ISO 8859-6 (Arabic)
- ISO 8859-7 (Greek)
- ISO 8859-8 (Hebrew)

... as well as box-drawing characters, all braille characters to make
it suitable for [[https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille][drawille]] and
mincellaneous symbols (math, punctuation, all circled numbers and
letters ...).

* More?

I have mosts of the glyph I need, and if you want some more, ask me
and I may add them!

Contributions are welcome as well.

* Build

The psf tty font is generated by a slightly modified version of
=bdf2psf= (to prevent a bug, I hardcoded the font width):

#+begin_src sh
  ./bdf2psf --fb\
            ../miniwi.bdf\
            ./standard.equivalents\
            ./miniwi.set\
            512\
            ../miniwi.psfu
#+end_src

Otherwise, I build the font with fontforge.

To generate the font set comments from the characters code, I used
this emacs macro:

#+begin_src elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "M-s s") 'isearch-forward)
(setq last-kbd-macro
   "\C-f\C-f\C-@\C-e\C-[w # \C-u\C-[:(char-to-string #x\C-y)\C-m\C-?\C-b\C-?\C-u\C-x=\C-xo\C-[ssE\C-?C-x 8\C-s\C-m\C-f\C-@\C-e\C-b\C-[wq\C-y\C-d\C-a\C-n")
#+end_src

And to count the number of characters that will be included in the
font, I used this regex: =^[0-9ABCDEFabcdef]\{4\}=
